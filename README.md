# Data Structures for Beginners
An early guide to DS     

## Overview

This repository as the name suggests contains, the variety of *Data Structures*, keeping in mind the Computer science **students** and **naive programming users**. There are bunch of programs implemented using *c* language, and are developed by keeping in mind the ***modularity, maintanability and readability*** for the beginners.

## Usage

Most of the problems belong to the native data structures like stack, queue and litte complex structures like tree, hashtable, dictionary etc. Programs developed here represents a proper flow from input using file and doing basic parsing, required operations and giving output in the *console*. 



Programs are named to give an intuitive feeling about what is coded it for, with having a sample input file in the same directory path.

I am progressing to give more explaination about the Input and Operations done by the programs. Since these programs are tested with a small set of input, hence they are not claimed to be run on a complex or compute intensive input. And mostly developed to give an early lessons for beginners.
