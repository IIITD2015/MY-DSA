# Data Structures for Beginners
> An early **hands-on** guide to Data Structures     

## Overview

Repository as the name suggests contains, the variety of *Data Structures*, keeping in mind the *Computer science students & naive programming users*. 

Programming implementations are done using *C*, by keeping in mind the aspect of *modularity* and *readability*.

## Usage

The developed programs belong to a category of basic data structures like *array*, *stack* and *queue* etc. A few of them gives fair idea of some of the complex data structures (like *tree*, *graph*, *hashtable*, *dictionary* etc). 

Programs represent a control flow as:

    Input file -> Parsing -> Applying chosen option -> Console output 


Programs are named to represent an intuitive understanding about themselves, and are kept in the related directories(Vig BST contains program for Binary-Search-Tree). Supplied sample input file(in the same directory path) helps to verify the output. 

For example, the BST directory contains the following files:
                  
    BST.h
    BST.c
    INPUT

Now Std instructions to run a program is as follows:


I am progressing to give more explaination about the Input and Operations done by the programs. Since these programs are tested with a small set of input, hence they are not claimed to be run on a complex or compute intensive input. And mostly developed to give an early lessons for beginners.
