# Data Structures for Beginners
> An early guide to DS     

## Overview

Repository as the name suggests contains, the variety of *Data Structures*, keeping in mind the *Computer science students & naive programming users*. 

Programming implementations are done using *C*, by keeping in mind the aspect of *modularity* and *readability*.

## Usage

The developed programs belong to a category of basic data structures like array, stack and queue etc. A few of them corresponds to category of complex structures like tree, graph, hashtable, dictionary etc. 

Programs represents a control flow from:

Input file -> Parsing -> Applying chosen option -> Console output. 

Programs are named to represent an intuitive understanding about themselves, and are kept in the related directories(Vig BST contains program for Binary-Search-Tree), with having a sample input file in the same directory path.


I am progressing to give more explaination about the Input and Operations done by the programs. Since these programs are tested with a small set of input, hence they are not claimed to be run on a complex or compute intensive input. And mostly developed to give an early lessons for beginners.
