# Data Structures for Beginners
> An early guide to DS     

## Overview

This repository as the name suggests contains, the variety of *Data Structures*, keeping in mind the *Computer science students & naive programming users*. 

There are bunch of programs implemented using *C* programming language, and are developed by keeping in mind the *modularity* and *readability* aspect for beginners.

## Usage

Most of the problems belong to the native data structures like stack, queue and litte complex structures like tree, hashtable, dictionary etc. Programs represents a proper flow from:

Input file -> Parsing -> Apply chosen option -> Console output. 

Programs are named to give an intuitive feeling about what is coded it for, and are kept in the related directories(Vig BST contains program for Binary-Search-Tree), with having a sample input file in the same directory path.


I am progressing to give more explaination about the Input and Operations done by the programs. Since these programs are tested with a small set of input, hence they are not claimed to be run on a complex or compute intensive input. And mostly developed to give an early lessons for beginners.
